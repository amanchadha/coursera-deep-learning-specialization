The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\napplications on a given network.\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\n\n\n\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\ncheck.\n\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\n\nEDUCATION\n\nB.E in CSE\n\nANNA University\n\n2011\n\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n\n2005 to 2007\n\nSKILLS\n\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTechnical Skills\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux","annotation":[{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7880,"end":8485,"text":"Programming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\nWCCP Protocol,\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\nSoftware\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\n\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7829,"end":7835,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7810,"end":7816,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7795,"end":7801,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":7777,"end":7783,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Skills"],"points":[{"start":7745,"end":7836,"text":"optimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":7731,"end":7734,"text":"2007"}]},{"label":["College Name"],"points":[{"start":7687,"end":7721,"text":"Day Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\n"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":7681,"end":7684,"text":"2011"}]},{"label":["College Name"],"points":[{"start":7664,"end":7679,"text":"ANNA University\n"}]},{"label":["Degree"],"points":[{"start":7652,"end":7661,"text":"B.E in CSE"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":6598,"end":6610,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Graduation Year"],"points":[{"start":5659,"end":5662,"text":"2011"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":5629,"end":5649,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":5560,"end":5572,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3651,"end":3671,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3503,"end":3515,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":3481,"end":3501,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1304,"end":1324,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":1288,"end":1300,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1174,"end":1186,"text":"Cisco Systems"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":1152,"end":1172,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":1136,"end":1148,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Years of Experience"],"points":[{"start":170,"end":176,"text":"4 years"}]},{"label":["Email Address"],"points":[{"start":102,"end":165,"text":"Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yasothai-Jayaramachandran/\nc36e76b64d9f477f"}]},{"label":["Location"],"points":[{"start":64,"end":70,"text":"Chennai"}]},{"label":["Companies worked at"],"points":[{"start":42,"end":62,"text":"Automation & Testing\n"}]},{"label":["Designation"],"points":[{"start":26,"end":38,"text":"Lead Engineer"}]},{"label":["Name"],"points":[{"start":0,"end":24,"text":"Yasothai Jayaramachandran"}]}],"extras":null}

INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, \"legacy\", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nModule - QX\nThe Qx interface is a company proprietary application layer protocol between target and the GUI\nof NMS. By this protocol, NE can communicate with SCC (System Communication and Control)\nsoftware in different operation system. Each command has defined format. Commands are given\nin binary form. Qx Module acts as an interface between the Client and Application.\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities. I was a module lead\nfor this project.\n\nRole: Designer/Developer/ Reviewer/\n\n\n\nResponsibility: Designing and coding various modules Involvement in peer review and overall\nreview activities and project discussions Coordinating the development cycle Training team\nmembers and solving project related issues configuration management of the project using Clear\nCase\nDuration: From June 2004 to Sep 2006\nHardware: X86, CPCI, ATCA\nSoftware: C++, C\nProject2: Wireless LAN - 802.11 MAC (Split AP Architecture)\nDescription of the project\nWireless LAN 802.11 describes MAC and PHY. Wireless stations are connected to form a basic\nservice area which is controlled by a base station called Access Point. Access Point is a special\ndevice which basically acts as a bridge between wired and wireless media connected to a\ndistributed system generally Ethernet. Several Access Points can be connected to a distribution\nmedia to form an extended service set.\nIn split AP architecture AP's connect to a central controller called Access Controller in short\nAC. AP has the minimal functionalities such as receiving the 802.11 data from the radio and\nforwarding data and management frames to AC, Power management, Advertising beacons,\nhandling control frames.
