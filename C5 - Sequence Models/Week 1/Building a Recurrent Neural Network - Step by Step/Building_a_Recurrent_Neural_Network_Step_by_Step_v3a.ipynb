    "# Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 5's first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement key components of a Recurrent Neural Network in numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a unidirectional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time-step. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Sub**script $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- $a^{(2)[3]<4>}_5$ denotes the activation of the 2nd training example (2), 3rd layer [3], 4th time step <4>, and 5th entry in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "* We assume that you are already familiar with `numpy`.  \n",
    "* To refresh your knowledge of numpy, you can review course 1 of this specialization \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\".  \n",
    "    * Specifically, review the week 2 assignment [\"Python Basics with numpy (optional)\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/item/Zh0CU).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Be careful when modifying the starter code\n",
    "* When working on graded functions, please remember to only modify the code that is between the\n",

    "# GRADED FUNCTION: routine_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "* The automatic grader (autograder) needs these to locate the function.\n",
