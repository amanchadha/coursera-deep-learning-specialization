    "# Building your Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 5's first assignment, where you'll be implementing key components of a Recurrent Neural Network, or RNN, in NumPy! \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define notation for building sequence models\n",
    "* Describe the architecture of a basic RNN\n",
    "* Identify the main components of an LSTM\n",
    "* Implement backpropagation through time for a basic RNN and an LSTM\n",
    "* Give examples of several types of RNN \n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory.\" They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some contextual information through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time step to the next. This allows a unidirectional (one-way) RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional (two-way) RNN can take context from both the past and the future, much like Marty McFly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation**:\n",
    "- Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object associated with the $l^{th}$ layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object associated with the $i^{th}$ example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time \n",
    "step. \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Subscript $i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ entry of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "- $a^{(2)[3]<4>}_5$ denotes the activation of the 2nd training example (2), 3rd layer [3], 4th time step <4>, and 5th entry in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "* You should already be familiar with `numpy`\n",
    "* To refresh your knowledge of numpy, you can review course 1 of the specialization \"Neural Networks and Deep Learning\":\n",
    "    * Specifically, review the week 2's practice assignment [\"Python Basics with Numpy (optional assignment)\"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/programming/isoAV/python-basics-with-numpy)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Be careful when modifying the starter code!\n",
    "* When working on graded functions, please remember to only modify the code that is between:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "#### START CODE HERE\n",
    "```\n",
    "and:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "#### END CODE HERE\n",
    "```\n",
    "* In particular, avoid modifying the first line of graded routines. These start with:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# GRADED FUNCTION: routine_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "The automatic grader (autograder) needs these to locate the function - so even a change in spacing will cause issues with the autograder, returning 'failed' if any of these are modified or missing. Now, let's get started! "

    "* The \"forget gate\" is a tensor containing values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    * If a unit in the forget gate has a value close to 0, the LSTM will \"forget\" the stored state in the corresponding unit of the previous cell state.\n",
