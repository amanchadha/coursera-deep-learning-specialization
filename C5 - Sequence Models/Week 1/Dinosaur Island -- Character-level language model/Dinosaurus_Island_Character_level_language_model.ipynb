To create new dinosaur names, you will build a character-level language model to generate new names. Your algorithm will learn the different name patterns, and randomly generate new names.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that your algorithm has started to generate plausible dinosaur names towards the end of training. At first, it was generating random characters, but towards the end you could begin to see dinosaur names with cool endings. Feel free to run the algorithm even longer and play with hyperparameters to see if you can get even better results! Our implementation generated some really cool names like `maconucon`, `marloralus` and `macingsersaurus`. Your model hopefully also learned that dinosaur names tend to end in `saurus`, `don`, `aura`, `tor`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model generates some non-cool names, don't blame the model entirely -- not all actual dinosaur names sound cool. (For example, `dromaeosauroides` is an actual dinosaur name and is in the training set.) But this model should give you a set of candidates from which you can pick the coolest! \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment used a relatively small dataset, so that you're able to train an RNN quickly on a CPU. Training a model of the English language requires a much bigger dataset, and usually much more computation, and could run for many hours on GPUs. We ran our dinosaur name for quite some time, and so far our favorite name is the great, the fierce, the undefeated: **Mangosaurus**!\n",
